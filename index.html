		<h1>Hyack Scout Camp</h1>

		<p>The Scouts of New Westminster invite Troops from all Areas and Councils to the join us at a camp that brings new meaning to the phrase "wilderness camping."</p>

		<p>Hyack Camp is unique. Held in Queens Park in the heart of the Royal City, it's a New Westminster tradition. When else do you get to camp in the middle of a city park alongside Troops from Burnaby, Vancouver, Surrey, the Tri-Cities and Washington state?</p>

		<h2>Activities</h2>
	
		<p>You'll arrive on Friday night and make the long and arduous trek - tens of metres! - from the street to the park. Once you've set up your campsite you'll head down to the <a href="http://www3.telus.net/dallydog/sapperton/index2.html" target=_blank>Sapperton Fish and Game Club</a>, whose members will once again provide firearms safety instruction and supervised rifle range shooting.</p>
	
		<p>On Saturday you're in for a hike, but it won't be like any hike you've taken before. The <a href="#parade">Hyack International Parade</a> is British Columbia's largest family-oriented parade with over 120 entries from British Columbia and the United States. We'll march in the parade before returning to camp for lunch (provided by the camp).</p>
	
		<p>Saturday afternoon's program is still being developed but past years have included demonstrations by the <a href="http://nwpolice.org" target="_blank">New Westminster Police Service</a> dog squad and the <a href="http://www.newwestcity.ca/residents/public_safety/fire__rescue_services.php" target="_blank">New Westminster Fire &amp; Rescue Service</a> as well as free swim passes to <a href="http://www.nwpr.bc.ca/parks%20web%20page/cgp.html" target="_blank">Canada Games Pool</a>. Bring your swim trunks!</p>
	
		<p>Saturday night will feature the traditional Hyack-campfire-on-the-ball-diamond, hosted by the 12th New Westminster Rover Crew. Where else do you get to sing around a campfire held at second base? Each patrol should be prepared with a song, skit and yell, and don't forget your campfire blanket!</p>

		<h2>Parade</h2>
	
		<p>The <a href="http://www.hyack.bc.ca/events/parade.php" target="_blank">Hyack International Parade</a> is about three kilometres in length and winds throughout New Westminster, starting at New Westminster Secondary School at 8th Avenue and 8th Street and finishing in Queens Park &mdash; right next to camp.</p>
	
		<p>The parade attracts thousands of spectators and thus provides an excellent opportunity to showcase Scouting. As such, we ask that you bring and wear your complete uniform and look as sharp as possible. Of course, you're more than welcome to bring your flags!</p>
	
		<p>In addition to participating in the parade as a marching unit, we also traditionally supply a number of Scouts to carry signs and banners in front of winning floats and at other points along the route. <strong>Each Troop participating in the parade will be asked to assist.</strong> The number of Scouts requested from each Troop will be based on a percentage of your total compliment and will be determined at camp once all Troops have arrived and checked in.</p>
